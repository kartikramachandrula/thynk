Picture this: you're working on calculus homework at 2 AM, stuck on a derivative problem. You scramble through old Reddit threads, fumble with your phone to photograph each step for ChatGPT, and wait for responses that explain the solution in a completely different method than what your teacher taught. 
We've all been there. That's what inspired thynk: a seamless, hands-free learning companion that teaches you using the exact methods your teachers did in class. No more breaking concentration to take photos, no more learning conflicting methods, no more friction between needing help and getting it. 
Thynk about it until you understand (wh)y, and we'll be with you every step of the way.

Thynk transforms the traditional learning experience using our smart glasses product. Unlike traditional AI tutors that require new photos for each step, thynk provides ongoing assistance throughout your entire problem-solving journey.
Simply say "Help" or ask a specific question out loud. No need to stop writing, grab your phone, or break your concentration. Thynk provides hints and guidance that build on your current approach and the lectures it listened to with you in class, rather than replacing it with a different method.  
Responses appear both as voice guidance through your glasses and visual aids on a connected device, accommodating different learning preferences. 
Whether you're working through calculus derivatives, balancing chemical equations, or debugging code, thynk provides the perfect balance of guidance and independence: helping you learn without doing the work for you.
